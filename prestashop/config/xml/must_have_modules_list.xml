Ideal for gift sets, assortments, bundles and box]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[A PRECIOUS TOOL FOR ADDITIONAL SALES Advanced Pack enables you to increase your average cart value by offering your customers the opportunity to purchase a coherent set of products, called a pack, at an attractive price. By grouping together products whose simultaneous sale makes sense (such as a camera, its tripod and the appropriate memory card), you guide your customers through their buying process, just as you would in a physical store, while saving them time. Indeed, by showcasing complementary products on the same page, you save them the hassle of searching for each product individually, with the risk of, for instance, not selecting compatible products. With the pack, they can add multiple items to their cart with a single click, ensuring they purchase the correct references. Thanks to your packs, you also enable your customers to save money by offering these product sets at a discounted price. For instance, Advanced Pack allows you to provide one of the products in the pack for free or to offer customized discounts based on the item combinations selected. Finally, creating a pack allows you to improve the visibility of certain products by associating them with your best-sellers. A FAST AND INTUITIVE PACK CREATION Inherit product information Select the products to be included in the pack, save: the pack can already be sold on your site with a set of default parameters. Nothing could be faster! All the properties of the products making up the pack are automatically retrieved (descriptions, prices, images, features, etc.) to save you time: no need to rewrite descriptions, reinsert images, etc... Advanced Pack automatically displays the images and descriptions of the products in the pack in tabs on the product page. You can then customize this display if you want! Your customers can therefore be properly informed about all the products in the pack while remaining on the same page, and finalize their purchase with a single click. Fine management of combinations Unlike PrestaShop's native "pack" functionality, you don't need to create a pack for each product combination: the module's creation tool allows you, for each product to be included in the pack, to choose the combination(s) you want to make available specifically for this mode of sale. For example, you can make only certain colors of a product available if it is purchased within a pack. You can also define a default combination for each product, even if it is different from the one defined in your catalog, in order to sell off certain stocks more easily. Once your pack is built, your customers are free to select, for each item in the pack, the attribute (color, size, dimension, ...) they want from those you have chosen to make available. They benefit from the same preferential discount defined for the pack, regardless of the chosen combination, even if the combinations have different prices (price impacts on combinations are taken into account). Pack Customization In addition to choosing the combinations to be included in the pack, you can let your customers change the quantity of each of the products included in the pack, or set them yourself. Advanced Pack also gives you the option of letting your customers remove a product from the pack, if they want. Would you like a product to be sold only through a pack? That's also possible! You can even make it a free gift. For example, you can offer an extended warranty for the purchase of a dishwasher. This extension will then be exclusively conditioned to the purchase of the dishwasher. With Advanced Pack, the customization possibilities are endless! (*)See conditions in "Features" section ENCOURAGE YOUR CUSTOMERS TO ORDER IN PACKS WITH A SPECIAL OFFER To encourage your customers to order a product as part of a pack rather than on its own, offer them a benefit they can't refuse! Advanced Pack allows you to create three types of sales offers. 3 types of sales offers are possible thanks to Advanced Pack: Offer a specific discount on each product in the packApply a general discount on all productsApply a fixed price to the pack, like a psychological price, for example In addition to these possibilities, Advanced Pack allows you to take into account, or not, the discounts that may already exist on your products. You thus have the choice between: reflecting existing discounts on the sale price of the packor, on the contrary, exclude them to favor the discount defined for the pack The module also includes a dynamic pack price simulator to help you create your sales operation. On the customer side, and unlike the native "pack" functionality, the sales offer related to the pack purchase is clearly highlighted on the product page. The visitor immediately understands that he can save money by favoring this method. QUICK AND EASY ORDER AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT Ordering a pack is managed in such a way that you retain the advantages of ordering separate products. First of all, the pack stock is calculated from the stocks of its products. There's no need to define stock at pack level. Each time a pack is ordered, individual product stocks are automatically deducted. Then, on the invoice and order details in the back-office, each product appears on a different line, as if it had been ordered separately. This has major advantages: No surprises when it comes to stocks: for each product, you have just one stock to manage, whether the product is sold on its own or as part of a pack. You avoid the complexities of managing two different stocks for the same product.Refunds and returns are managed at the individual product level: for example, you can refund only one product in a pack, or put a returned product back on sale.Easy management of products with different VAT rates: the invoice displays the tax amount for each different VAT rate.Ability to export pack orders to an ERP-type management and analysis system, without having to make any technical modifications to enable it to take pack orders into account. Moreover, if one of the products (or a product combination) in a pack is out of stock, the pack will automatically be indicated as unavailable for purchase using an availability alert system. No risk of you receiving orders for unavailable products! An option also allows you to force the display of another combination if the default combination is out of stock. INCREASE PACK VISIBILITY WITH CROSS-SELLING For even greater visibility, you can display a block "This product is also available in pack" on the pages of products that are also part of a pack. In this way, thanks to a dedicated commercial offer, you can encourage your customers to order the pack rather than the product alone. In short, this is cross-selling: an accessible and effective way of increasing your average cart! POSSIBILITY TO SELL A SAME PRODUCT IN BUNDLES (minimum compatibility PrestaShop 1.7.7.0) Do you have products that can be packaged in bundles of several units? Offer your customers the chance to save money by ordering a product in a bundle rather than individually, thanks to a dedicated offer. They'll be able to order the bundle directly from the page of the concerned product.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[merchandizing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.2.16]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.1.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.3]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[279.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[317.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[243.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1653761/1653761-pprod.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1653761/1653761-pbig.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[1768]]></id><name><![CDATA[gmerchantcenter]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Google Merchant Center (Google Shopping)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Price Comparison]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Export your products on Google Merchant Center to display catalog on Google Shopping, Google Search, Google Image, the Display network (YouTube, Gmail,&hellip;) and Google partners!

Shop Product Reviews allows you to collect your customers' opinions about your products but also about their general shopping experience on your shop. Do you want to know their opinion on specific points? Define your own rating criteria, either for your products or your shop. You want to import your old reviews to keep your history? No problem, the module offers a simple and intuitive import/export tool! And if you currently have the native module of PrestaShop (Product Comments) or the module of store and product reviews from Línea Gráfica, the import is totally automatic, you do not have to do anything, you just have to install our module and it takes care of retrieving the history of your reviews! Our module respects the GDPR and all the European directives in force (such as the decree n° 2017-1436, or the directive (EU) 2019/2161) concerning the information obligations related to online consumer reviews, by putting in place everything necessary for the customer to be informed in a clear and precise way about the review management system. It allows you to display a "Verified Purchase" badge to certify that the review is a result of an order, and only customers who have an account can review your products and your shop. INCREASE YOUR CONVERSION RATE AND YOUR REVENUE 88% of Internet users consult customer reviews before making a purchase on an e-commerce site and 91% of 18-25 year olds give as much importance to reviews on the Internet as to those of their relatives. By displaying customer reviews of your products and/or your store on your website, you increase your customers' trust in your brand. Customer reviews are a social proof of your store's reliability and play the role of a digital word of mouth. The importance of customer reviews in the e-commerce world is well known: they are now a key element in the decision-making process and in your marketing strategy. Moreover, customer reviews are a great free advertising tool and a way to get relevant, recent and regularly renewed content. This UGC (User Generated Content) is one of the main criteria examined by Google to improve your SEO. If your theme is properly tagged, Google will be able to show the stars corresponding to the average rating of the products in its natural results which will also improve your visibility, your click rate and your traffic. Our "Shop Product Reviews" module is much more than a simple review collection module. With its multiple features and options for displaying reviews, whether on product pages or list pages, through dedicated blocks or badges, our "Shop Product Reviews" module allows you to reassure your customers, reduce shopping cart abandonment and increase your conversion rate. According to a study, from the first review posted on a product, the conversion rate increases by 10%, then 30% after 50 reviews, and up to more than 44% with 200 reviews! So don't hesitate! COLLECT REVIEWS ON YOUR PRODUCTS, YOUR SHOP OR BOTH! The "Shop Product Reviews" module allows you to activate independently the collection of product reviews and the collection of reviews on your store in general. For each review system, many options are available: activation of moderation, display of reviews only in the current language, activation of a voting system, display of a "latest reviews" block, etc... The product ratings will be displayed as stars. You have the ability to customize the color of the stars to fit your theme as there are an infinite number of colors available. A "Verified Purchase" badge can be displayed next to the reviews that result from an order, to further reinforce the confidence of future buyers. The color of the badge is also fully customizable as well as its text. Whether it is for product or shop reviews, a system of precise scheduling of the sending of rating request e-mails is available. You also have the possibility to send a reminder if your customer has not given a review following the first e-mail. The titles and texts of the e-mails can be configured directly through the module, for each language of your store. Product reviews Give the possibility to evaluate a product to all registered customers or only to customers who ordered the product. The latter option makes it possible to further increase the reliability of customer feedback on your products. Enjoy flexible positioning on product pages: Display your reviews either in the footer or within a tab (if your theme supports page tabs), and decide where to position the average product rating. Also decide to display the average product rating on list pages. Allow your visitors to filter the reviews by rating and sort them as they want. Show them the distribution of the number of reviews by rating and allow them to get a quick and global idea of the reviews on a product, by enabling the display of a "battle" block showing the best review and the most critical one opposite each other. Also note that by implementing product reviews, the average rating can appear in Google's natural results as stars, which will attract attention and increase your visibility. Links that display a product rating have a click-through rate (CTR) between 15 and 30% higher. Shop reviews Why not also collect feedback from your customers about their overall shopping experience? Activate shop reviews and allow your customers to share their feelings about their experience on your site, the choice offered, the offers or even the ease of payment and delivery! This will strengthen the bond you have with them by showing them that you are listening to their needs and will contribute to increase loyalty. Place the link to the shop review form wherever you want on your website: customer account, product pages, menu, ... The module also allows you to display a "shop review" badge with the average rating given by your customers to your store, on the pages of your site while choosing its position and color. CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOM CRITERIA Do you want to know what your customers think about particular points? Create your own rating criteria! Whether it is for products or the store, the module offers you the possibility to create personalized criteria. You decide how the criteria are worded and whether you want to reserve them for certain products or categories! Use the product rating criteria to ask your customers to rate specific characteristics of certain items in order to validate or not your choice of products or suppliers: fabric quality, price, fit of a garment, sturdiness etc... It is a free way to know the efficiency of your catalog and a precious help to make informed decisions about your products. As for the rating criteria for your shop in general, you also have the choice: navigation, site ergonomics, variety of products, clarity of descriptions, ease of payment, or even choice of delivery points! The feedback from your customers will allow you to make the right choices and get a better customer satisfaction rate. Not to mention the SEO benefit of the criteria! If you guide customers by asking them to give feedback on specific topics through the rating criteria, your customers will tend to use specific keywords that will boost your SEO on certain queries. ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO POST A REVIEW BY OFFERING THEM A VOUCHER Your customers sometimes need a little help! Encourage them to leave their opinion on the products they bought, or about your shop, by offering them a voucher in exchange! This will encourage them to come back to place an order on your online store and will increase their loyalty. Once your offer is configured within the module, it will be displayed in the rating invitation e-mails and also in the product or shop rating forms. BUILD CUSTOMER LOYALTY BY REPLYING TO REVIEWS Our module allows you to send a reply to customer reviews, whether positive or negative. You can also choose to display this reply below the customer review on your store. Indeed, while customer reviews are essential, it's also important to reply to them to show that you offer a quality service and that customer satisfaction is your priority. You also encourage future customers, who will see your replies, to share their experience. By taking the time to respond to your satisfied customers, you show them that you're grateful to them for taking the trouble to give their opinion, and you reinforce their attachment to your store. As for dissatisfied customers, it's never easy to respond to them, but it can be an excellent opportunity to show them, and other visitors, that you're listening, that you understand their dissatisfaction and that you're doing everything you can to try and find a solution. What's more, if they see that you take customer relationships to heart, there's a good chance they'll change their rating...]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[front_office_features]]></tab><version><![CDATA[4.4.4]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.1.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.7]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[97.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[114.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[84.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="PrestaShop&#39;s Favorite"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/ps-selected.png]]></badge><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1623258/1623258-pprod.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1623258/1623258-pbig.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[6320]]></id><name><![CDATA[totshowmailalerts]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Product Out of Stock : Emails and Number of Requests]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Stock & Supplier Management]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Discover the #1 solution that allows you to learn which out-of-stock products are your clients most interested in.

With "Multiple Features", for the same product and the same feature, you have the possibility to assign very quickly as many values as necessary and to sort them, which PrestaShop does not allow natively. You can therefore easily enrich the description of your products. In addition, you can choose the character to be displayed between the values of the same feature. If you also use our "Advanced Search 5" search by filters module (https://addons.prestashop.com/en/search-filters/87818-advanced-search-5-search-by-filters.html) or its Pro version (https://addons.prestashop.com/en/search-filters/2778-advanced-search-5-pro-filters-and-facets-seo.html), you further increase the search relevance in your catalog.Our module is also compatible with the PrestaShop faceted search native module. Import your features and their multiple values in bulk action! Use the PrestaShop native CSV import tool to assign in bulk, and in a specific order, feature values to your products. In your "Products" CSV import file, use the "Feature(Name:Value:Position)" column to define for each feature the values to be assigned to each product. Indicate in the module configuration the character used to separate the different values and that's it! Example: Separator used: | Material:Yellow gold|White gold,Type of gemstone:Diamond This product will therefore be assigned 2 values of the feature "Material", and a single value of the feature "Type of gemstone". Optimize your internal linking Add links to your feature values to link to SEO pages (facets), for example, and improve your SEO.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[search_filter]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.5.6]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.6]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[69.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[79.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[62.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1656172/1656172-pprod.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1656172/1656172-pbig.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[6946]]></id><name><![CDATA[invoicepayment]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Invoice Payment ]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Payment by Invoice]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[The payment by invoice is very popular in many countries, especially among German and Swiss customersWith this module, you can offer the invoice payment method to your registered customers in order to]]></description><author><![CDATA[Silbersaiten]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/payment-invoice/6946-invoice-payment.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/6946.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[The payment by invoice is very popular in many countries, especially among German and Swiss customersWith this module, you can offer the invoice payment method to your registered customers in order to provide a safe shopping experience.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[With this module, you can offer a bill payment to your users.

It now allows you to include groups of cookies by purpose, so that cookies can be grouped according to their purpose and the end user can accept only those they need. Using the configurator options you can change the name and description of the purpose.*Important: the groups of technical cookies must be accepted.By default, 5 groups have been included:Functional (technical)AdvertisingAnalyticalPerformanceOther cookies Updated module to fully comply with the Marzo 2021 cookie regulations.

Updated to comply with the latest modifications of the RGPD.Full compliance with the European Law on Cookies (last modifications of the RGPD – Update 2021)New customisable informative responsive configuration banner.In addition to inserting a warning banner, it is the only module that allows third party modules that use cookies to be blocked until the user gives his consent.Furthermore, it gives you the option of customising the module to comply 100% with the new requirements of the RGPD (European Union). Our Cookies module complies with the Right of Rectification, with it users can delete the cookies installed from the site simply by accessing a url or even from their own customer profile. Obtaining consentThe user has to click on the “I accept” button in the warning banner to give his consent. As soon as the client gives his consent, the warning banner disappears and all the modules that use cookies will be activated and will work as usual. The user can configure the type of cookies to which he or she wants to give consent by clicking on the ‘Manage Cookies’ button and selecting which cookies he or she wants to activate or not.Blocking CookiesThe module allows the blocking of cookies until the user gives his consent. Cookies can be functional (mandatory) or from third parties. They allow the user to give his or her consent separately. This complies with the law as it differentiates the different types of cookies that the client accepts.Functional (mandatory) cookies: includes the key cookies for the operation of the website. For example, save the login data, the shopping cart, etc.Third-party cookies: includes cookies that collect data for tracking, segmentation, analysis, etc.In order to comply with the directives of the LSSI, we recommend that you deactivate the tracking modules (such as Google Analytics), social network modules (Facebook’s “Like” button, Google’s “+1” button, etc.) and targeted advertising. Please note that the modules required for the proper functioning of your shop (e.g. shopping basket cookie, session cookie…) do not require prior consent.Línea Gráfica will in no case be responsible for any damage or harm caused by activating options which do not comply with the RGPD. The user is responsible for the legal texts which indicate the purpose of third party cookies. Please note that the user/owner of the e-commerce where the module is installed is solely responsible for the legal texts to be introduced, such as the notice and explanation of the purpose of third party cookies. Linea Grafica will in no case be responsible for any damage or harm that may be caused by activating options that do not comply with the RGPD. Revocation of consentIn compliance with the law, the user may revoke their consent at any time. As soon as they withdraw their consent, the installed cookies are eliminated and consent is requested again. Banner content and customizationTo comply with the LSSI, the module allows you to customize the message that appears in the warning banner (to inform about the cookies used and their purpose) and add a “More information” button to the banner that takes the user to a CMS page of your website (to explain in detail the use of cookies in your store).The notice banner is responsive and always occupies the entire width of the window. The module includes a Wysiwyg editor that allows you to fully customize the content of the banner (font, color, effects, html code …). You can also choose from the configuration page the background color of the banner, its opacity percentage (transparency) and its position (above or below the screen). In addition, the module is multi-language and automatically detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to write a different message per language.Information: we have developed the module so that it does not appear when search engine robots crawl your website and that it does not affect your SEO. Block screen until cookies are acceptedTo help the online shop lose as little information as possible it has an option that does not allow the customer to browse until they accept the cookie policy, i.e. it blocks the screen until the user accepts the cookies. Notice in the form of a pop upThe module displays a pop up to inform your customers about the use of cookies and ask for their consent for their installation. Multi-store modeThe module is compatible with multi-store mode and allows you to put the same warning banner in each of your stores, but the consent is the same for all your stores. If you accept cookies for one of your stores, the module will consider that you have accepted cookies for all your stores (indicate this in the Cookies Policy) and the warning banner will not appear later in the other stores.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[administration]]></tab><version><![CDATA[2.1.11]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.2.1]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[69.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[79.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[62.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1663503/1663503-pprod.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1663503/1663503-pbig.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[8741]]></id><name><![CDATA[dmulistecommandes]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[DMU Improved Order List]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Order Management]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Optimize order preparation by reducing the number of clicks.Save time by hovering over and displaying order information without going into detail]]></description><author><![CDATA[Dream Me Up]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/order-management/8741-dmu-improved-order-list.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/8741.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Optimize order preparation by reducing the number of clicks.Save time by hovering over and displaying order information without going into detail.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[With the help of the module developed by Dream me up, you can manage your stocks with precision and ensure on-time delivery to your customers.

The “Free Delivery Manager” module is actually the perfect solution for offering your respected customers free shipping through objective rules. It is the promise of a rise in the amount of orders with total control of delivery costs.  The module allows you to calculate in advance, with the help of precise rules, the necessary conditions for unlocking free delivery. The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.  The “Free Delivery Manager” module offers control of delivery costs by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to order more.  Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really control the impact of delivery costs. The second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied. Thus, the “Free Delivery Manager” module increases the value of transactions as well as the number of orders!  This module has been constantly evolving, many thanks to user feedback. TimActive, in fact, grants great importance to your perception of our solutions and of the improvements that can be added. ]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[shipping_logistics]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.8.0]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.2.1]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[125.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[143.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[110.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="PrestaShop&#39;s Favorite"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/ps-selected.png]]></badge><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1516710/1516710-pprod.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1516710/1516710-pbig.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[8934]]></id><name><![CDATA[migrationpro]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[MigrationPro: Effortless PrestaShop Upgrade & Migration]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Data migration & Backup]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Upgrade or migrate your PrestaShop store from any version (1.3 to 1.7) to PrestaShop 8 effortlessly with MigrationPro—the #1 trusted migration module]]></description><author><![CDATA[MigrationPro]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/data-migration-backup/8934-migrationpro-effortless-prestashop-upgrade-migration.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/8934.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Upgrade or migrate your PrestaShop store from any version (1.3 to 1.7) to PrestaShop 8 effortlessly with MigrationPro—the #1 trusted migration module.

Increase customer trust and sales while reducing date-related support requests. Show your customers the estimated delivery date, from basic to elaborate configurations, on the product page, order process, and emails.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[The importance of delivery dates cannot be overstated, particularly for customers eager to spend their money in your store. This module assists you in assisting your consumers by providing features that make the overall purchasing experience of your customers easy and efficient. When shopping online, you probably have found yourself wanting to know when a product will arrive more than once. There might be several reasons for this, such as that you need the product by a specific date or are eager to receive it... In all of these cases, knowing the estimated delivery date of the product can influence your purchasing decision by increasing your trust in that shop and making you more comfortable and secure in making the purchase. From the owner’s perspective, once configured, you will see a drop in all support inquiries relating to delivery dates (this has been verified by our clients numerous times) and an increase in the sales, making the investment completely worthwhile. Internally, the module always attempts to separate its configurations into two modes: basic and advanced, making it possible to configure the module in 5 minutes while still allowing for complex configurations for those shops that require precise setups. This is possible because the module’s features handle the preparation and delivery process as if it were real life. To help you understand how it works, we've presented some of the features you’ll find particularly helpful. Geolocation: The module uses unregistered users' geolocation to determine which carriers should be displayed for that customer. The customer's stored addresses will be used after they've logged in. Display modes and customization: Without editing a single line of code, a broad range of choices are available to simply define each parameter, such as style, time format, location, and colour of the Estimated Delivery information box.Carrier-based configurations: You can set all carrier parameters globally or individually for each carrier with the advanced options.Global settings: Date modification using global parameters such as categories, manufacturers, or suppliers Product-based configurations: When configured, they override the general settings, enabling you to change the delivery time of your items by utilizing the module's unique characteristics (picking days, out-of-stock additional days, release dates, available dates...). This can be accomplished at the product or combination level. Orders and emails:The Estimated Delivery date option can also be enabled during the order process. The date can be displayed optionally on the summary, in the carrier selection phase, and finally on the order confirmation page. When this functionality is enabled, clients and administrators may check the delivery date from the order history at any time.Following the placement of the order, the delivery date can be included in the shop emails by adding a special variable on the templates. Orders by picking (pickup dates):A visual guide for determining which orders should be prioritized to meet the projected delivery dates generated at the time of the order.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[shipping_logistics]]></tab><version><![CDATA[3.9.8]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.8]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.2.1]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[83.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[99.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[75.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1540002/1540002-pprod.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1540002/1540002-pbig.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[19126]]></id><name><![CDATA[iqitmegamenu]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Horizontal and vertical mega menu (navigation dropdown)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Menu]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[The most advanced responsive mega menu Prestashop module.&nbsp; By using Drag&amp;Drop builder you can easily create horizontal or/and vertical dropdown navigation, and responsive mobile menu]]></description><author><![CDATA[Community developer]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/menu/19126-horizontal-and-vertical-mega-menu-navigation-dropdown.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/19126.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[The most advanced responsive mega menu Prestashop module.&nbsp; By using Drag&amp;Drop builder you can easily create horizontal or/and vertical dropdown navigation, and responsive mobile menu. &nbsp;]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[IQITMEGAMENU is highly customizable responsive menu module.&nbsp;  Vertical and horizontal menu With our module you can get both navigations inside only one package.

EVEN MORE DATA CONTROL WITH THIS PROFESSIONAL VERSION&nbsp;With more than a decade of success, the standard version of our Google Merchant Center (Google Shopping) module is by far&nbsp;the most robust and complete&nbsp;Google Shopping module on the market.&nbsp;This&nbsp;professional&nbsp;version goes even further with&nbsp;exclusive&nbsp;features such as the ability to create precise product exclusion rules, to manage&nbsp;advanced&nbsp;custom labels, or to export your promotions and product reviews(*).&nbsp;GO EVEN FURTHER IN OPTIMIZING THE DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR ADS&nbsp;In addition to the multiple possibilities of configuring your feed that the standard version of the module already offers, you will be able to refine the choice of products or product combinations to be exported thanks to the setting up of extremely precise and personalized exclusion rules.&nbsp;Thanks to the advanced assignation of custom labels, you will also have the ability to segment your product catalog and therefore organize your ads according to the seasonality of your products, their popularity, or the margin you can apply to them. This allows you to control your budget by offering the right products at the right time and optimize your return on investment.&nbsp;In Shopping ads, the display of stars reflecting the rating of items undoubtedly gives more attractiveness to products.Google Merchant Center Pro allows you&nbsp;to export your customers&#39; product reviews(*)&nbsp;and to participate in the &quot;Product Ratings&quot; program. The reviews are collected and compiled with reviews of the same products from other sources&nbsp;(including &quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot; - see next paragraph - review aggregators, ...).&nbsp;If conditions are met, the average product rating can then be displayed in your ads and free product listings in the form of one to five stars.&nbsp;Finally, what better to encourage people to click and buy than a discount voucher featured in your ad? Thanks to our module you can filter and&nbsp;export the promotional codes&nbsp;to attach to your ads.&nbsp;(*)See conditions in the &quot;Features&quot; section&nbsp;HIGHLIGHT THE QUALITY OF YOUR SERVICE WITH GOOGLE CUSTOMER REVIEWS&nbsp;The PRO version of the Google Merchant Center module integrates the &quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot; feature.&nbsp;&quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot; is&nbsp;a free service&nbsp;that lets you collect, via Google,&nbsp;your customers&#39; reviews about their shopping experience.&nbsp;If they agree to participate, they receive an email a few days after receiving their order, asking them to rate their experience between 1 and 5 stars and to leave a comment if they wish. Once a certain number of ratings have been collected, through &quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot; and third-party rating partners, Google can include this seller rating in your text ads and free listings. You can also display it on your store, as part of a &quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot; badge.&nbsp;Through &quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot;, Google can also collect&nbsp;your customers&#39; reviews of products ordered from your online store&nbsp;and compile them with those sent through your product review feed, for example (see the &quot;product ratings feed&quot; feature of the module).]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[smart_shopping]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.7.17]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.1.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.5]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[251.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[287.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[216.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1634634/1634634-pprod.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://assets.prestashop3.com/addons/p/1634634/1634634-pbig.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[21318]]></id><name><![CDATA[magicredirect]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Redirections URL (301 / Auto-fixing / Multishop / SEO)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[URL & Redirects]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Predicts and automatically fix missing pages !

The most useful module for Dropshipping and for synchronization with an ERP, since you can move / copy products by hand, but also by means of a PROGRAMMED TASK. MOVE / COPY / CLEAN COMPLETE CATEGORIES You can move complete categories only by choosing the source category and the destination category. In this way, the products will no longer appear in the source category, to appear in the destination category. You also have the option to copy one category into another. The products of the source category will also appear in the destination category, so your products will have more visibility and increase the sales of your store. If necessary, you can also clean an entire category, so the products in that category will belong to the start category of your Prestashop. MOVE / COPY SPECIFIC PRODUCTS If you are interested in not moving the entire category, if you only want to move certain products you can also do it very easily.
